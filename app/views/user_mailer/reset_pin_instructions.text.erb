Below are instructions on how to reset your HashBros PIN
========================================================

Please follow the following link: <%= @reset_url %>
The link will only be active for 15 minutes. If you do not reset your PIN within that timeframe, you will need to request another PIN reset email.
If it was not you who performed the change, please login <%= @login_url %> and change your security settings <%= @security_url %>
